	<ul>
		<li>My goals for Web Design I are to learn as much as I can <br>about coding and designing for the web and to be able to <br>create a beautiful, functional and well-designed website <br>at the end of the semester.</li>
	
		<li>My goals for Info Architecture are to focus on the user <br>and to effectively collaborate with others.</li>

		<li>My goals for GD II are to push myself to think more <br>conceptually and to be confident in my ideas.</li>

<li>My goals for my art history class is to find some way to <br>make it interesting so I can survive sitting through 3 hours <br>of lecture a week. YIKES.</li>

	<li>And finally, my goals for my ceramic work (this is my <br>first semester at MassArt not taking a ceramic elective <br>and I am missing it!) is to log at least 5 hours a week in <br>the studio and be able to throw a nice set of bowls and <br>push myself to explore other forms and techniques.</li>
	</ul>
