<p class="p2">My goals for Web Design I are to learn as much as I can about coding and designing for the web and to be able to create a beautiful, functional and well-designed website at the end of the semester.
	
My goals for Info Architecture are to focus on understanding the user and learning how to collaborate with others. 

My goals for GD II are to push myself to think more conceptually and to be confident in my ideas. 

My goals for my art history class is to find some way to make it interesting so I can survive sitting through 3 hours of lecture a week. YIKES. 

And finally, my goals for my ceramic work (this is my first semester at MassArt not taking a ceramic elective and I am missing it!) is to log at least 5 hours a week in the studio and be able to throw a nice set of bowls and push myself to explore other forms and techniques.</p>
